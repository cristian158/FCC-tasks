        <article class="">
          <p>Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should
            start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure
            and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out.
            For example, you can use CSS to alter the <code>font</code>, <code>color</code>,
            <code>size</code>, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns,
            or add animations and other decorative features.</p>

        <article class="">
          <p>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS.
            We recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.

            Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn
            further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth between the
            two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting and much more fun
            to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.</p>
          <p>Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using
            computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it, consuming
            the content). You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed
            in Installing basic software and understand how to create and manage files,
            as detailed in Dealing with files — both of which are parts of our Getting
            started with the web complete beginner's module.

            It is also recommended that you work through Getting started with the web
            before proceeding with this topic, especially if you are completely new to
            web development. However, much of what is covered in its CSS basics article
            is also covered in our CSS first steps module, albeit in a lot more detail.</p>

          <p>This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for
            working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.</p>

            <h2>CSS first steps</h2>
              <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages —
                for example, to alter the <code>font</code>, <code>color</code>,
                <code>size</code>, and spacing of your content,
                split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
                features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards
                CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like,
                and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

            <h2>CSS building blocks</h2>
              <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained
                familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience
                with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the
                cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units,
                sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>
              <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent
                CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving
                on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>

            <h2>Styling text</h2>
              <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to
                concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with
                CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font,
                boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text
                features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your
                page, and styling lists and links.</p>

            <h2>CSS layout</h2>
              <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text,
                and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside.
                Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation
                to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so
                we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings,
                modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the
                legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>

      <section id='Solving_common_CSS_problems' class='main-section'>
        <header>Solving common CSS problems</header>
        <article class="">
          <p>Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content
            explaining how to use CSS to solve very common problems when creating a
            web page.</p>
          <p>From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and
            their backgrounds; change the size, shape, and position of elements; and
            add and define borders on elements. But there's not much you can't do once
            you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. One of the best
            things about learning CSS is that once you know the fundamentals, usually
            you have a pretty good feel for what can and can't be done, even if you
            don't actually know how to do it yet!</p>

        <header>"CSS is weird"</header>
        <article class="">
          <p>CSS works a bit differently to most programming languages and design
            tools you'll come across. Why does it work the way it does? In the
            following video, Miriam Suzanne provides a useful explanation of why
            CSS works like it does, and why it has evolved like it has:</p>
